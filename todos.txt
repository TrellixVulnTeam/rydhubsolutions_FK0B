refactor the repetetive and bad code                                                                            -i did a lot of this, still got more to go tho

add back button when on product page

-rename products app to catalog

when i drag the vuper slides to move them it still registers as a click and opens the page,             -temporarily fixed by disabling the drag feature.... xd






the standard data format between frontend and backend should be json

security, validating and sanitize user inputs!!! should try to do a fuzz test afterwards

xss, cross site scripting?

look up and learn about "django template json"
